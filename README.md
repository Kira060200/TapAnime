# TapAnime

**TapAnime** is a free, light-weight android application designed for anime fans and otakus! It's a small game

### Features

An android application dedicated to all anime lovers. 
The app contaisn 3 main functions:
*login and sign up
*chat client
*"game" mode with 3 sub-games(training, quick-play, competitive)
*one more minigame coming soon

Right now, it has only the single-player mode(you are asked a seris of questions, the questions are based on major anime titles). I am working on the quick-play mode and it should be available soon !
